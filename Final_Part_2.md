# High-Fidelity Wireframes:

I used Figma, Shorthand, Tableau, and Flourish to create wireframes and storyboards, and conduct user research to improve my storytelling concept.

## User Research 

Through my story, I am trying to reach and educate designers, who use various tools to create great websites and who also follow WCGA guidelines, but still somehow fail to make these websites fully accessible, that the problem still exists.

The nature of my story is based on spreading awareness, therefore it was important to talk to people who have designed websites or been in a process where they had to communicate with stakeholders in order to address an issue. Thus, for the purpose of this study, it was important for me to talk to professionals from the web design domain and learn about their perspective and that’s how the participants were chose. 

I started with a comprehensive understanding of a website and app's complete design and development cycle through my secondary research. This enabled me to identify the tools used during the design phase, such as color contrast checkers and audit tools used during the development phases.I then explored and tried to define personalized accessibility and discussed how temporary conditions hinder individuals from consuming web content and gaining similar value as before. This led me to explore the web accessibility space.

I tried to bring my shorthand story to a stage closest to final so that they have get a full understanding what I am trying to tell my audience. I decided to break my story into two large sections :

* There is more to disabilities that needs to be taken into consideration.
* But how can we do that when the current websites are not even fully accessible ?

I did not want the sections to be apparent. I wanted the transition between the sections to be as subliminal as possible. 

## Interviews 

After presenting the Shorthand storyboard to participants, we discussed few questions to get their perspectives on general attributes of the story. The questions that were discussed were as follows - 

* Does the title of the story seem appropriate ? 
* Does the flow of the story make sense to you ? Was it easy to follow/comprehend or you had to figure out somethings by going over it again and again? Anything that could help make the story better?
* What do you think of the graphic/aesthetic of the story ?
* Did you find this story insightful ? did you learn something you didn’t know ? is there anywhere I can build more clarity or add/remove content ?
* What do you think of the data visualizations ? Any other comments?


### Feedback from the Interviews

This section summarizes participant comments, insights, and findings from my observations of them going through the story that provide helpful guidance for refining the story further in Part 3. 

**USER 1** 

AGE 25, UI DESIGNER - Worked on designing multiple web and phone websites and apps

* The title "web for all the lenses" may be more appropriate than "web through all the lenses" since the content discusses making the web accessible to people of all ages and abilities.
* The changing eye color visual effectively illustrates how vision can evolve over a lifetime and provides an insightful perspective.
* The story and different vision issues are clearly and simply depicted through the visuals, making the concepts easy to grasp.
* Using a consistent color palette across the information graphics could improve them.
* Changing the final image to people looking at a screen rather than painting may make a stronger impact and better reinforce the core message.

**USER 2**

AGE 27, SOFTWARE DEVELOPER - Worked on developing chrome plugin for web accessibility

* The title and subtitle work well together to convey the themes of inclusivity and accessibility. The title on its own leans more towards inclusivity, while the subtitle makes the accessibility focus clear.
* The content flowed well overall. The transition between disability types and examples could be smoothed by adding more context about temporary/situational disabilities before the statistics.
* The timeline showing WCAG failure growth over the years is an excellent addition.
* The page provides digestible content without being overwhelming. The blue on black color contrast works for differentiation, but the black text on blue could interrupt reading flow.
* It may be helpful to allow hovering on the "Analysis of 1 Million home pages" chart to view the average error percentages.
* The visuals are consistent and understandable across the story, with good use of color.
* The statement about "vision loss" could be reworded as "vision impairment" to align with the cited source.
* The core message of each chart is easily grasped on first view.
* Labeling the "% "units directly on the "Growth of 65+ Internet Users" chart could add clarity.

**USER 3** 

AGE 29, PRODUCT MANAGER - Has knowledge of how to convey product opportunity gaps to stakeholders

* The animation speed for the graph showing the increase in senior internet users may be too fast. It is unclear whether to focus on the graph or the accompanying text. Slowing down the animation could help make the graph more self-explanatory.
* The representation of "50 errors per page" is understandable but takes some time to digest. Using a different visual design or layout could make this data point easier to grasp quickly.
* Using a color gradient in the graph depicting age-related color vision issues could better illustrate the increase and make the correlation more obvious.
* Adding explanatory text before the data visualizations could provide helpful context and orientation for readers before they dive into analyzing the charts and graphs.
* The data visualizations provided new insights and gave food for thought, especially regarding the first category.

## PROMPT FOR NEXT STEPS FOR PART III - 

_The visuals could be enhanced through more consistent use of color palettes across charts, optimized contrast for readability, and design adjustments like hover-over data, labels directly on graphs, slowed animations, and reworked layouts to allow quicker comprehension of key data points and relationships. Transitions between sections could be smoothed by improving accompanying visuals and graphics to add clarity. Modifying images to align with core messages and using color gradients to better illustrate correlations are other visual refinements suggested._
