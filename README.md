Portfolio of Data Visualization Projects 

## Hi There!

I am a User-Experience Designer aspiring to design highly impactful strategies, driven by curiosity, fueled by diverse experience, and sustained by pragmatism. Currently, pursuing my master's degree in Integrated Innovation for Products and Services from Carnegie Mellon University, I am learning about the different aspects of product development including design, engineering, and business.

During my tenure at Carnegie Mellon, my enthusiasm drove me to enhance my data visualization skills. This motivation led me to enroll in a course Telling Stories with Data, instructed by Chris Goranson, during the fall of 2023, where I aimed to grasp the knowledge of transforming intricate datasets into engaging visual narratives that convey insights effectively.

My objective was to learn diverse data visualization tools and techniques, comprehend the fundamental principles of visual design, and delve into the intricacies of storytelling through data. I aspired to become proficient in choosing the appropriate visualization methods for varying data types and audiences. Additionally, I aimed to refine my ability to critically evaluate and enhance existing visualizations.

The below collection represents my journey in honing these skills, urndertaken during the 7 week long course.
